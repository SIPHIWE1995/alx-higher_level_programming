JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to add interactivity, manipulate web page content, and create dynamic user experiences. JavaScript is commonly used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build interactive web applications and is executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser. It supports event handling, DOM manipulation, and can be used both for front-end and back-end development through platforms like Node.js. JavaScript is known for its flexibility, as it supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
